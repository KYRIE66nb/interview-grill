# Interview Grill (Desktop)

A desktop app that turns interview prep into a **repeatable training loop**:

- One-click **Mock interview (15m)**: project deep dive -> backend fundamentals -> algorithm warmup
- **Review report**: 5-dimension score + 3 actionable fixes + tomorrow practice plan
- **Persistent history**: close/reopen without losing progress
- Designed for **consistency**: 30-minute sessions, quick hints when stuck, spaced review (planned)

If you are preparing for **Tencent/ByteDance intern** (or any SWE intern), this helps you practice the two things that matter most:

- **Answer structure under pressure** (tradeoffs / metrics / risks)
- **Progress you can measure** (scores, weak tags, weekly wins)

## Why It Gets You Better (Not Just Busier)

- **Low friction**: open -> start -> answer -> review -> done
- **Realistic follow-ups**: forces you to defend decisions and quantify impact
- **Actionable output**: every session ends with concrete next steps
- **On-device by default**: no cloud required

## What You Can Do Today

- Run a **15-minute mock** interview session
- Generate a **review report** (scores + improvements + tomorrow plan)
- **Save** the report as JSON
- Reopen the app and keep your session history

## Roadmap (Near-Term)

- Daily dashboard: Today tasks (2 problems + 1 mock + 1 mini-lesson)
- Competition mode (Lanqiao): infinite practice + mistake tags + similar problems
- 408 mini-lessons: tiny lessons with examples + memory cards + progress bars
- Resume bullets: export a concise Chinese resume-ready summary from your sessions
